- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow

## Data Science Tools

| Tool         | Description                               |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Jupyter      | A tool for creating and sharing notebooks |
| RStudio      | IDE for R programming                     |
| GitHub       | Version control and repository hosting    |

## Arithmetic Expressions
In this section, we will demonstrate basic arithmetic operations such as addition and multiplication.

# Multiplying and adding numbers
a = 5
b = 3
multiplication = a * b
addition = a + b
multiplication, addition

# Convert minutes to hours
minutes = 120
hours = minutes / 60
hours

## Objectives
- To demonstrate data science languages and libraries
- To perform basic arithmetic operations
- To convert units such as minutes to hours
